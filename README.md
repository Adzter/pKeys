# pKeys
Addon for Garry's Mod that implements a similar system to Teamspeak 3's privilege keys.  
An admin gives you a random string, you open up a prompt, you put in that string, BOOM, you get whatever rank or privilege the admin desires.  
No more waiting for admins so they can add you. You add yourself.  

Modify the config file at pkeys/lua/autorun/pkeyConfig.lua
